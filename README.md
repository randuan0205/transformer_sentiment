# transformer_sentiment
Using the powerful transformer model to implement sentiment analysis upon IMDB movie reviews

## purpose of this project:
1. learn how to build a modulized transformer model from scratch.
2. learn how to adapt transformer modules to a real world use case - sentiment analysis.
3. practice on model saving/loading/inference.
4. Get a deep understanding of how transformer model works by look into the self-attention mechanism.
5. Practice on some important NLP actions: tokenization, embedding.

## The result:
### show the model measurment:

## coding
### Modulized transformer

### Adapt the modules as a classification model to fulfill the request of sentiment analysis

### a AI model training module, learned this from the book <deep learning with pytorch step-by-step>, added some of my edition: early stopping, print loss based on parameter of epoch interval, LR auto adjustment??

## learning self-attention's alpha

## Reference: give credits to the author, David, of book <pytorch step by step>

## things can be done in future: extend the length of the sentences, change to use context enabled embeddings
